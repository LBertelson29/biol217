# Designing an -OMICs project - what to consider
## Experimental design 
### Initial project design
- Replication 
- Consideration
  - Material
- Money
  - Number of samples & sequencing depth
- Dimension 
  - conditions and parameters
- Time

### Pitfalls in the lab 
- Yield 
  - Amount of input sample requiered
- DNA/RNA
  - Quality
- Extraction 
  - Sample type, experimental steps
- Sequencing
  - Short and/or long reads

### Bioinformatics
- Assembly pipeline
  - De-novo or reference assembly
- Interprentation
  - Statistics and visualisations
- Time

## Deeper sequencing or more replicates?
- More replicates (low sequencing depth can still reveal biology, more return on the money with more replicates than deeper sequencing)
- Power Analysis Software can help determine the number of replicates

## Using negative controls/positive controls

## Research questions 
### -What kind of sequencing do I want to use?

### -Co-Assembly or Individual Assembly?


# Task: Creating our own -OMICs Project
